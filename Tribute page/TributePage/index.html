        <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> was a German-born theoretical
          physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two
          pillars of modern physics alongside quantum mechanics. His work is
          also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is
          best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence
          formula E = mc^2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous
          equation".

        <p>
          Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of
          Württemberg in the German Empire. He was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize
          in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially
          for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".
        </p>
        <p>
          Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and over 150
          non-scientific works. He died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New
          Jersey, USA.

        <blockquote>
          "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is
          limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating
          progress, giving birth to evolution."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>"The only source of knowledge is experience."</blockquote>
